# mpltracker

NOTE: currently this does not work when built and installed through the setup script [see bug report](https://github.com/kecnry/mpl-viewer/issues/1).  Any examples will need to be run within the mpltracker directory until this bug can be tracked down and fixed.

See examples in example directory.
