# mpltracker

This module intercepts all calls to matplotlib and then allows you to do any of the following:
* save the figure to a json-formatted file which can then be reloaded
* show or save the image
* access the data arrays
* export the arrays to an ecsv file formatted to submit directly to the journals (work in progress)

See several examples in example directory.
